# Project Description
The online Bookstore system models a bookstore in which a vast array of books can be viewed and catalogged by a user. The system will keep information about its books,registered
, and unregistered customers. Thus, the system should provide a registration facility for its users. As an online system, the bookstore system is available to
all web users. Web users should be able to browse available books and to search for books, but only registered users (customers) can place orders by adding books to their shopping
cart and checking out. Another user, the administrator, has the ability to manage promotions and view the enitre collection of users and books in the system.
